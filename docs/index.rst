Welcome to exporter's documentation!
====================================

Exporter automates exporting projects from `FIT CTU GitLab <https://gitlab.fit.cvut.cz/>`_ to `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_.
It allows choosing which projects to export, their renaming, and visibility on GitHub.
Also, there is an option for exporting all of your GitLab projects at once.

Check Quickstart :doc:`HERE </quickstart>` for examples.
