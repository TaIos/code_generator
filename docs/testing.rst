Testing
=======

Exporter has set of tests that it is supposed to pass. All tests are written using `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/>`_.

Command for running the tests is `tox <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
Easy way how to run all tests is to run this command in `cloned Exporter repository <https://github.com/TaIos/exporter>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ tox # run all tests
