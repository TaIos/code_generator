= Semestral work from NI-PYT in 2020/21
* CTU username: `saframa6`

== Goal

* TEXT to HTML translation using GPT-3.

In this work I use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3[GPT-3] to translate arbitrary input text to HTML. Example output might look like https://twitter.com/sharifshameem/status/1282676454690451457[this].

== Requirements for grading

1. Use `requests` for communicating with GPT-3 API
2. Create command line interface that accepts input text and produces HTML
3. Load configuration from file using `configparser`, at least allowing to use own GPT-3 API key
4. Write tests using `pytest`, but also allow to run them using `tox`
	. Fake GPT-3 API using `betamax`
	. Internal funcionality
5. Make it availible on Pypi as a package
6. Document project using docstrings in code and this README
7. Create GUI using `PySide`, that in addition to the CLI interface renders HTML output and displayes it to the user
